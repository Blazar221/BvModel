## Property 
### Customized Sphere
The size, position, color, transparency, flash frequency of the node are settable.
### Customized Line
The color and width of the line are settable.
### Float Text Label
The text label can be set in any position, always facing to the camera. The text label will be present only when it is close enough to the camera.
### Data Layer Switch
The model can contain more layers of data, and users can use slide bar in the screen to choose which layer to show on the screen.
### Bigdata Support
The model is able to display 2k balls while keeping high fps (for now). Some properties will be sacrificed to display more, say 10k, balls and lines.
